# Temporal and Spatial Variation in Stress Levels within a Population of Pikas

## Summary
This notebook is based on data collected by Ashley Whipple at the Niwot Ridge Long-term Ecological Research Program in Colorado, US. The full data set can be downloaded [here](https://search.dataone.org/view/https%3A%2F%2Fpasta.lternet.edu%2Fpackage%2Fmetadata%2Feml%2Fknb-lter-nwt%2F268%2F1). Over a course of three months in 2018, the researchers collected fecal specimens from 20 different Pika territories and analyzed them for their concentration of stress-associated hormone metabolites. In the accompanying [research article](https://academic.oup.com/conphys/article/9/1/coab024/6262596) [1], the authors explore the effect of habitat characteristics and seasonal variation on Pika stress levels and find that shared seasonal circumstances appear to have a higher impact on stress than differences in individual habitat quality.
In this notebook, I implement an analysis workflow in Python and R, following along with the paper's methods and findings, diverging at certain points to provide additional insights into the data.
